- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is JENNIFER
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development and tech as a whole, I love learning new things, I love reading, travelling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Software Engineering student at ALX Africa and am looking forward to improve my skills and do better in the front-end development.
- Future goals: I hope to contribute more to the community and learn more about the new technologies coming up and most importantly make a difference when it comes to women in tech.
